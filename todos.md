### Object-Oriented Design Patterns

- Find a book on this topic:
  - Check out: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
- Most important to know:
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method

### Graphs

- Determine if an undirected acylic graph is a tree (DFS)
- Topological sort
- Shortest path in a directed acyclic graph
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman-Ford
- A-star (A\*)
- Floyd-Warshall (less essential, but it's short so no reason not to)

### Regex

- Study JavaScript RegExp patterns/syntax!
