## About

Goal: sorting the array from lowest to highest.

 1) Begin at the start of an array. If the second element is lower than the first, swap the two. 
 2) Do the same with the following pair, etc. 
 3) Reiterate through the array until the entire array is sorted.

This called "bubble" sort because with each pass, the smallest elements slowly bubble up to the beginning of the array. 

## Runtime

- Average: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Memory: O(1)
