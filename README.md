# Algorithms & Data Structures

## About

Hello! Welcome to my personal repo for algorithms and data structures study
material. I will be adding to this repo periodically while I continue to study.
Most of the material will be drawn from Cracking the Coding Interview, but I
will also be compiling information from other sources as well, such as [Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course](https://zerotomastery.io/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and others. Feel free to to
take a look around and use this information for your own study benefits.

In general my plan is to do the following: 
- Collect general information about each data structure into a readme file (About.md).
- Find or create a good implementation of that data structure (DataStructure.solution.js).
- Develop unit tests for that data structure using Jest (DataStructure.test.js).
- Using [spaced repetition software](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for maximum efficiency, test myself at regular intervals to ensure retention of that data structure's implementation. Use the unit tests to validate when I've implemented the data structure correctly.
- In addition, I will be using spaced repetition software to ensure retention of other details about each data structure. 
- Finally, I will be performing coding challenges on various sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) to practice my problem-solving skills as well as practice implementing these data structures in the context of algorithmic challenges.
