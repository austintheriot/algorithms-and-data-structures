# Algorithms & Data Structures

## About

Hello! Welcome to my personal repo for algorithms and data structures study
material. I will be adding to this repo periodically while I continue to study.
Most of the material will be drawn from Cracking the Coding Interview, but I
will also be compiling information from other sources as well. Feel free to to
take a look around.
