## About

### Queue

- Queue = FIFO, first-in first-out
- Like a line to the movie theater
- Basic operations:
  - add(), add to the END
  - remove(), remove from the FRONT
  - peek(), return the front element
  - isEmpty(), returns true if the Queue is empty
- Double check operations that update the first/last nodes in the queue, since
  these are easily messed up.

Can be implemented as an independent data structure, or as a linked list, so
long as the elements are added and removed from opposite ends.

Used frequently in breadth-first searches or caches.
